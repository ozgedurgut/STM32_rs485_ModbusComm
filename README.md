# STM32_rs485_ModbusComm
The data read from the pt100 sensor was transferred between two stm32s using the rs485 communication protocol.

It is a project created for the communication of two stm32s.

By uploading **RS485toTTL_stm32_second** and **STM32_RS485_Com** files to the stm32s separately, communication is provided with the max485 module.
